EvenOdd
=======
The application sends even and odd counts to two nodes separately. 

This application uses a minimum of two nodes. The nodes receiving used are to be named node 3 and node 4. Both the transmitting and receiving parts are in the same application. The count is displayed in each node through the leds.

The expected result would be that the nodes named 3 and 4 should respectively show odd and even counts on their leds.
